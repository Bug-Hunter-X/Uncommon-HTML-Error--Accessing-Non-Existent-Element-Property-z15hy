This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML that involves attempting to access a property of an element that does not exist. The error occurs when using document.getElementById() to retrieve an element that is not present in the HTML document.  This leads to a TypeError in the JavaScript code. The solution involves checking for null before accessing the element's properties.
